Drive is a permanent, decentralized, uncensorable public file sharing app built on the Arweave network.

Our goal is to provide an easy, tamper-proof way for people to share documents, media, and applications with others without fear of data loss or censorship.

## Development

To start code generation, run:

```shell
flutter packages pub run build_runner watch
```
