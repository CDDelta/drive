## Data Collection

Drive collects no data user data.

All user data is processed locally and uploaded onto the Arweave network directly from the user's device including your private key.

## Data Storage and Retention

Data uploaded onto Arweave (Drive's backing data store) will be permanently stored online and be available publicly to all. Care should be taken to ensure private personal data is not shared as there is no way to delete them after upload.
